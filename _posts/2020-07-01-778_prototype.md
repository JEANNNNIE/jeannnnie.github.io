We design our product through a procedure below:

## 1. User Inquiry & Persona
+ **User Research**  
  We talked with different latent users and filled in a table for each user.

+ **Persona**  
  We classified all the users into 5 types and made a persona for each type.  
  + Young People

  + College Students

  + Middle-aged Persons

  + Pregnant Women  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/5.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Mothers  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/6.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Comparison  
    Based on 5 types, we concluded 4 types of uses finally and made a comparison.

## 2. Card Sorting & BluePrint
We used [OptimalSort](https://www.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/) in this session.
+ **Card Sorting**  
  We launched our hybrid cart sorting task in OptimalSort, click [here](https://80o5t3dj.optimalworkshop.com/optimalsort/lt5y6hp2/sort) to view it.  
  Participants were required to classify all the 17 functions depending on their thoughts.  
  ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/8.png){:width="700px"}  
  The results are as below:  
  + Standardization Grid  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/9.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Similarity Matrix  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/10.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Dendrogram  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/11.png){:width="700px"}  
+ **Blueprint**  
  We made an initial blueprint based on results of card sorting, and then applied tree testing to optimize it.  
  + Tree Testing  
    We launched our tree testing task in OptimalSort, click [here](https://80o5t3dj.optimalworkshop.com/treejack/s7843ox1-1) to view it.  
    Participants were required to choose a path to finish a given task. We designed 6 tasks.  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/12.png){:width="700px"}  
    For each task, we collected participants' performance data and formed a graph like below:  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/13.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Final Blueprint  
    After revising the initial blueprint with tree testing results, we got the final blueprint.

## 3. Task Model & User Journey
+ **Task Model**  
  For each of the 6 tasks designed for tree testing, we designed a task model accordingly like below:  
  ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/15.png){:width="700px"}  
+ **User Journey**  
  We synthesized the 6 simple tasks to 2 comprehensive tasks, and made 2 user journey.
  + Comprehensive Task 1: Finish an Afternoon tea.  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/16.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Comprehensive Task 2: Find a vegetarian restaurant and calculate heat quantity of a meal.

## 4. Wireframe & Prototype
+ **Wireframe**  
  ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/18.png){:width="700px"}  
+ **Prototype**  
  We posted our prototype to Axure community, click [here](https://26d48v.axshare.com/) to view it.    
  Based on wireframes, we designed a prototype with Axure. Some representative functions are shown below.  
  + Log in

  + Search  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/20.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Post a recipe  
    ![avatar](/assets/images/778_prototype/21.png){:width="700px"}  
  + Detailed information

## Usability Testing  
We designed 3 tasks and a 5-Point Likert Scale based on the tasks to test the usability of our app.

Gathering the data, we got some advice to improve our app.
