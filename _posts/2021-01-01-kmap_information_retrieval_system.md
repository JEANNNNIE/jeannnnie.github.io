Abstract: [Purpose/significance] This study aims to identify the influence of knowledge map on individual learning 
outcome under exploratory search situation,to optimize the design of the search system and to promote learning outcome. 
[Method/process] A user experiment was conducted where several tasks were designed with varied level of difficulty. The 
SOLO taxonomy evaluation method was used to compare the quality of learning in different types of tasks with and without 
the support of knowledge map. [Result/conclusion] The results showed that knowledge map can improve the learning outcome
of users in exploratory search situation, especially in helping users establish multi-point structure and association 
structure. This finding is helpful to understand the role of knowledge map on usersâ€™ exploratory search and provides 
support for improving the design of human-computer interaction function in exploratory search system.
